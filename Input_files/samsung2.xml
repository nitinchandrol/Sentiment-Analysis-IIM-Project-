It is cost effective. Everything works fine in this mobile. I would suggest that if you want to buy a mobile within budget with all features equal to class smartphone  then go for Samsung core I8262.

It was functioning well. Suddenly since 15.6.2014, it started giving problem - not charging and the battery was totally drained out. Today I have deposited the instrument with the Authorised dealer of Samsung as detailed below :â€‹From: Mukkavilli dharma prakasa rao &amp;lt;mukkavilli.dharmaprakasarao366@gmail.com&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;Date: Tue, Jun 17, 2014 at 11:15 PM&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: Fwd:&lt;br&gt;To: Electronyx Bazaar &amp;lt;info@electronyxbazaar.in&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank  you very much for your reply. As advised by you today I took the instrument to your Authorised Service centre M/s Suman Telecom Services, Tarnaka, Secunderabad 500017 and the same is deposited vide their work order No. 1425 of date and Bill No. 4175869616. I understand major replacement of main parts such as mother board etc., are to be replaced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is very surprising just after usage of 6 days how the major parts needs to be replaced and now I am scared to handle the instrument. As it is under warranty, the major items are being replaced and what is the guarantee it does not get break-down again. As I have passion to have all samsung products in my use i.e. Laptap, AC, Washing Machine etc., I am rewarded heavily by supplying me a defective unit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In view of above, please arrange to replace the item with new one and I am not interested to use the present repaired one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently I returned from USA with lot of SAMSUNG products as gifts and no one complained about the performance rather they are all very happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please ensure to deliver me the new unit or else please return me the payment of Rs.12,690/- paid by me for the product.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanking you and awaiting for a prompt reply. I am not collecting back the unit from your Authorised Service Centre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;M.D.P.RAO  HYDERABAD  9849565017&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Tue, Jun 17, 2014 at 12:32 AM, Electronyx Bazaar &amp;lt;info@electronyxbazaar.in&amp;gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;Sir&lt;br&gt;Please do the needful now, I want replacement with new item (not defective like present one)&lt;/div&gt;</value></reviews><rating><value>&lt;span class="swSprite s_star_3_5 " title="3.7 out of 5 stars"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.7 out of 5 stars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</value></rating><link>http://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B00D8XYAIO?pageNumber=2</link><title><value>Amazon.in: Customer Reviews: Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)</value></title></item><item><reviews><value>&lt;b&gt;Good phone but donot buy it from Amazon&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;This one is the Affordable Phone with Brand Name .. you get almost what you need in very affordable price ...

Don't buy from Next Online, very poor after sales response.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Nice phone with good features at this price.&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;I have purchased this phone after research of phones in market. I found it is a good choice after using it for one month. I can get good battery backup after setting inbuilt battery saving function. I got 2 days battery backup for my average use. Screen quality is decent and the sound quality too. I like the quality of  Sound through headphone, it's amazing. No lags in general games like Subway surfers, Temple run2, etc if battery saving is off. Battery saving mode reduces game performance. Overall it's a good choice over Sony xperia M &amp;amp; LG L7 II dual P715. I think it's worth to buy because of Good display, Ram 1GB, Internal memory 8Gb and good performance.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;samsungs good phone but&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Its a good phone by samsung in a budget category. Getting 4.3 screen with 1 GB ram is very good combination&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;however&lt;br&gt;the body is made by cheap material, the screen resolution is not good compare to moto g&lt;br&gt;and off course camera quality is average.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone wants budget phone with good configuration, then go for galaxy core.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;poor power storage&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;This item working good but dont keep battery power , maximum power 5 hrs thats all then low battery  , this mobile poor power storage&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Review - Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Features are fine but would have feel happy if they given flip cover with the handset.&lt;br&gt;I would suggest to go with Grand2 instead of this.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;warranty certificate&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;warranty certificate &amp;amp; packing material list yet not received.operating manual also not received.kindaly send it as soon as possible.so i utilise it.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Price in this site is bit high compare to other site&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Price of this product Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 in this site is bit high compare to other site.

It was a decent device when it was launched,but now,for the price you can get far better devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Display : 480 x 800 pixels, 4.3 inches ie only 217 ppi. The screen brightness is not that great,which means it is very difficult to see the screen under sunlight. The viewing angles are good.There is also no light sensor which means Auto brightness feature is not there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Processor : Dual-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A5 processor. This is no powerhouse Good enough for your day to day tasks,but lags behind the quadcore processors coming with similarly priced devices like Canvas Magnus, Turbo Mini,Xolo Q Series, Moto G etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Antutu Benchmark : 7470 ( For a comparison to show how low the performance is, Xolo Q700 scores - 13000, Micromax Turbo Mini - 17000 )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camera : 5 MP , the image quality is not that great. It can't even record 720P HD videos while even many under Rs 8000 devices are able to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Operating System : Samsung TouchwizUI on top of old Android 4.1 Jellybean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Battery : 1800mAh. This is NOT good enough to take you through one day of moderate use (with internet on). Cheaper Xolo Q700 priced at Rs 8500 ships with a 2400mAh one is to be noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verdict : Galaxy Core is not a value for money device in my opinion, as many other devices coming at this price ships with far better performing components and newer Android version. Buy this only if you want a 'branded' budget device and are ok with the issues it comes with.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Not a good purchase from Amazon&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;The product is good but Amazon has DELIVERED A DEFECTIVE PIECE TO ME.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The device heats up and also there is reception problem. The device looses connectivity every now and then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope that Amazon will call me to address my concern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please do not buy phones from Amazon!!&lt;/div&gt;</value></reviews><rating><value>&lt;span class="swSprite s_star_3_5 " title="3.7 out of 5 stars"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.7 out of 5 stars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</value></rating><link>http://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B00D8XYAIO</link><title><value>Amazon.in: Customer Reviews: Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)</value></title></item></items>
