I love it.... Thank u amazone.. Great service n trustable...n this phone is mind blowing... Again than yiu so much amazone.. For giving it on very low price&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;WORTH IT&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Wont be disappointed. Go for it!!&lt;br&gt;At 18.5k, it was a dream come true.. as i always wanted an iPhone!&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Good Deal&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Very Good Deal from Amazon site...............&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please keep amazing offer to the customers......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i recommend amazon.in site.........&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks a lot Amazon...&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;amazon really amazing and Apple iphone 4 is still very good and stable&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Very good delivery by Amazon and more cared on packing.&lt;br&gt;The deal was very good for 18.5 K and it very good for my professional needs like complete office exchange sync, mails, calendars, task, reminders and contacts and mobile contact sync with exchange and gmail connectivity are awesome. Really very stable connections, quality of app is very good than android.&lt;br&gt;Very light weight iOS loads fast and navigation is very smooth. A BIG no to Android and windows OS. Those for computer kids to play by installing buggy software‚Äôs and playing with some open source programs. No guaranty for your data and you cannot trust android phone. Last 3 year I had very bad experience and lost more than 50 INR by changing phone. Huge unwanted software come with andrioid phone and max 6 month you can enjoy after that even if you not install anything it will lag. Really&lt;br&gt;painful, tried Samsung s3 and some HTC models. Crap ÔÅå&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple iphone 4 is still very good for call, stable for Office mail sync, personal Mail, SMS, planners, finance software and Office software‚Äôs, camera and flash and very good stuff is GPS and compass is extraordinary.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;No words are required for the phone.&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;It is a great phone with ios platform. I faced one problem of sound in the phone but the service station of iphone replaced the phone with the new phone without any question. Customer Service is one of the best in the world.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;great phone&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;the best smartphone till date...&lt;br&gt;IPHONE 4 even though getting outdated but still better way better than other latest smartphones..&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Great product....&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Iconic product. Amazon pricing was good too and got my old iphone 4 replaced with another one at a nice price.&lt;/div&gt;</value></reviews><link>http://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B00CL8XFJW?pageNumber=4</link><title><value>Amazon.in: Customer Reviews: Apple iPhone 4 (White, 8GB)</value></title></item><item><reviews><value>&lt;b&gt;iPhone 4 for 18k with 10% cashback&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;I know a lot of ppl will think it is not worth the money n what not , but this is still the most perfect phone out there.&lt;br&gt;Just the perfect size.&lt;br&gt;Some really good cases available for less.&lt;br&gt;Never will it lag( I did not upgrade to iOS 7)&lt;br&gt;And simply the best looking phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not compare with any android phone cuz it has gotten so very common.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Enjoying my iPhone&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;IPhone is really awesome, its above the expectations.&lt;br&gt;Earlier I was using SAMSUNG Note, I was very Disappointed and it was totally waste of money.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Apple is the Best Always!!&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;First of all, i should thanks amazon and thier vendors for this wonderful offer(18550 rs)!! We cant get this price anywhere!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pros:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.As you know, Phone Body Design always excellent in iPhone and its best.&lt;br&gt;2.Latest Updated iOS is the best for using this phone&lt;br&gt;3.Excellent Display.&lt;br&gt;4.Good Sound Clarity while you listen music via headhones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cons:&lt;br&gt;1.Restricted Storage Space and its quite normal in iphone. You can use icloud if you have good data connection.&lt;br&gt;2.Speaker Volume is less&lt;br&gt;3.No Back button and unable to close the application&lt;br&gt;4.Restricted Bluetooth&lt;br&gt;5.iTunes is not that much user friendly.&lt;br&gt;6.Cant set the custom ringtone in phone directly but you can via iTunes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, Having the iPhone is always proud!!! Hence Go for it&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Best phone amid others .No comparison with others at all!!!&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Best phone amid others .No comparison with others at all!!! I have been using it for  last 6 years .No complaints at all !!!&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;My new best friend!&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;The iPhone 4 is a power packed performer that does full justice to its features and specs. A bit heavy on the battery life but a fulto paisa vasool phoneüëçüëç&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;awesome...amazon&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Hi,  i bought two phones in white color..awesome experience from amazon....my friend using it he fuly satisfied with product nd he updated ios 7 also..fine working nd battery back up also nice...for me am using as apple ..not much ..using just for calls phone gives prestige nice product ...great amazon bought with citi card 1500 cash back lets c for cash back credit..if cash back worked cheapest 17000 ...&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Awesome Diwali Deal - Iphone 4&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;I just love Amazon and Saholic for fantablous offer. IPhone 4 in just 18.5 K plus 1500 cashback on citibank card. So net price of 17 K is mouthwatering offer. Not even a single website / retail in India offered such an agressive price / deal. Great Show :)&lt;/div&gt;</value></reviews><link>http://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B00CL8XFJW?pageNumber=5</link><title><value>Amazon.in: Customer Reviews: Apple iPhone 4 (White, 8GB)</value></title></item><item><reviews><value>&lt;b&gt;Apple iPhone 4&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Good Buy...value for money...I will suggest this phone as this is the best phone one can buy in this budget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;amazing price&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;The best price I had ever seen..tnq...checked the warranty details in apple.com...100% genuine...totally satisfied..accessories are also original...keep going.. AMAZON :)&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Don't give things it boasts&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;The iPhone attracts everyone with its glamorous looks. Its a good phone to have while going out. But the performance of the phone was not as much as expected. The iPhone takes too long to startup. Immediately after startup the phone hangs for some moments. It also hangs while playing  games like subway surfers. One good thing is that the iOS is updated to the latest version. So if you are a busy man who uses his phone for functions like calling, messaging, mailing ect. only, its a good phone to show off. But if you want to use the phone for fantastic gaming experience and using wide range of apps, I think it'll be a bad choice...Remember it was introduced to the market about three years ago...&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Perfect phone!!!&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;This phone is awesome. Apple has done it right by re-introducing iphone4 for India. Also, I got great deal from Amazone. Excellent service.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Best with iOS 7.1&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Good even great phone to have but do upgrade iOS to 7.1 after purchase for best functioning ... Happy apple useling ...&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Great phone at amazing Price&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;There are many people who are saying that apple is dumping it's 4 yr old phone in india,Kindly don't listen to them.&lt;br&gt;This phone is superb.Although it is a 4 yr old phone,still it beats most of the phones currently in it's range.&lt;br&gt;If you have doubt of memory.if you think that "Will 8gb memory will be sufficient?" then the ans is yes.It's not like android in which you will going to face memory leak problem. 8gb is good enough.&lt;br&gt;  lastly,Thank you amazon for delivering the product in 2 days,product was safe too.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;not a prompt seller&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;the phone which i bought is an unlocked mobile , i wasted my time and money by taking this phone to my service provider&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;iphone buy with amazon&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;I get apple iphone safety. phone heating very much.....overall all is not bed.&lt;br&gt;buy more and get more.............  ok  all&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Hang problem apeaker problem&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;My i phone is not working as it should be if you can help me with that the.

I got a good deal at Amazon and ordered this. The package was delivered within 24 hours! Delivery process was amazing. Balle balle to Amazon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;iPhone is very well built, and should last a long time. Accessories are also very good. Also, for a phone that is 2 generations old, it is pretty fast. in fact, it is as fast to operate as an Android in my home, which is the latest model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wanted something that was not too large, had a very good build quality and was easy to use. I was looking at Nokia and Apple products. Nokia was too bulky and all the iPhone owners I spoke to were very happy with their products so I went for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is very easy to setup. Only problem is getting a micro SIM - which any mobile shop should be able to do. Speakers fidelity is very good. Display is also great. Applications like facebook are also very well designed. Touchscreen is amazing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a bit expensive, but I feel its good value. And I also used 4S and 5 in stores but could not discern an appreciable difference in performance. Maybe the camera is better, but I use a DSLR so I am not sure what the improvement in the picture quality will be. The photos I clicked were good considering this is a mobile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this review helps you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Review after 6 months of usage - The phone has stood up well. I have installed lots of apps for my kids and they love playing with this phone. I feel the material for this phone is better than the 5 series and takes abuse well. The glass surface does not get scratched and I use a phone guard as well. My friends who have 5 have scratches on the back side of their phone but my phone with a glass back looks really good even now. In terms of device looks and construction, this is hard to beat in the market. All we see nowadays are plastic phones with plastic screens which don't feel that nice in the hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for iOS 7, its a huge step backward for iPhone4. If you are thinking of upgrading from iOS6, don't even think about it. If you are buying a new phone, buy Android since iOS7 looks so much like Android anyway! iOS7 on iPhone 4 and 4S is slower than iOS6, and works Ok on iPhone5 series. I think Apple have lost it after Steve left. The apps are slower on my phone but I just use facebook and my kids use my phone more than me so its Ok till they don't complain! The interface to make phone calls and read messages has also become slow and a bit irritating but the construction and the looks of the phone are still hard to beat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would I would buy an iPhone4 again? I might, because it looks good, is constructed well and will stand up to kids playing with it. I don't do too many apps and stuff so I am Ok. But I would definitely look for a good deal since its an old phone. I would also prefer to have a set that has iOS6 installed!! But if I get a Nokia Windows phone or an Android with tough glass construction, I would prefer that anyday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Update after 8 months - the iOS7 has killed the device. It has become so slow that I am sometimes tempted to just throw it - but having spent 20k plus on this, I tell myself to use it for some more time. I don't use many apps and I keep resetting the device and closing open apps. Still the phone runs amazingly slow now. Messages take forever to open. Searching for contacts to make a simple phone call is arduous. When you make a call, and you want to go to bluetooth or speaker, the other person has said hello 5 times before those options turn up on the screen. Please stay away from this phone unless you get one with iOS6. I have reduced the rating to 2 stars.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Best service ever I have got in my 6 years of online experience!&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;I have always considered that flipkart has the best services, may it be refunding process, replacement process, cancellation process or delivery time. But this time, amazon.in has played its part after stepping into the world of competition in Indian market. Trust me I'm amazed the way they have started their website by such low prices for almost every product. Their own courier facility is even better than Flipkart that anyone can rely on it without keeping any followup. I must say that other leading websites like Flipkart and Ebay must start thinking upon their new rival now as its gonna be the best in few time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish you guys all the very best! Kudos!!!&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Really bad piece&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Phone produces some disturbance while calling and is nuisance  .... There is a disturbing notice when I am trying to call some one .. I have used the phone with utmost care but the problem has popped up suddenly&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Nice&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Got it for 18000 bucks..thanx to saholic..market price is around 22500 and here on amazon too its again available for more than 20K. nice buy&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;good service&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;we received the package within a day. The service was excellent and it was well packaged  cant ask for more. also well priced&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Joke&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;This phone was the thing that led to the advent of smartphones we use today. Respect for that.&lt;br&gt;But looking at it alone, buy this now would be a Joke. Biggest Joke.&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;awesome&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;i got it like few weeks ago and i m very satisfied but d fine heats up while charging  but after putting on a case on it it is normal&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;best price i got for iphone4&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;I got iphone 4 at best ever price, best product at price, good customer service with quick response too. thanks..&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;Budget Phone with Premium feel&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;Knew all technical specifications so no surprises there. But Got very good deal at amazon &amp;amp; nearly saved 3-4 K .&lt;br&gt;Good phone to gift&lt;/div&gt;</value><value>&lt;b&gt;bill&lt;/b&gt;</value><value>&lt;div class="reviewText"&gt;give me the bill of iphone 4,&lt;br&gt;i need  bill for technical support .&lt;br&gt;please prove me bill of phone&lt;/div&gt;</value></reviews><link>http://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B00CL8XFJW</link><title><value>Amazon.in: Customer Reviews: Apple iPhone 4 (White, 8GB)</value></title></item></items>
